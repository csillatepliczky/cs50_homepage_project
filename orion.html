                            Orion is of the most conspicuous and recognizable constellations in the night sky, that got its name after Orion, a hunter in Greek mythology.
                            It is located on the celestial equator and visible throughout the world. In the Northern Hemisphere it is most visible from January to April, and
                            in the Southern Hemisphere during the summer months. In the tropics the constellation transits at the zenith.

                            Orion is one of the oldest constellations due to its bright stars, and it played an importart part in many ancient mythologies. In many star lores the three
                            middle stars ('The Orion Belt') and the and the four stars around them forming a rectangle had different names and myths sorrounding them.
                            In ancient Egypt, the stars of Orion were regarded as a god, called Sah. As Orion rises before <a href="canismajor.html">Sirius</a>,
                            the star whose rising was the basis for the Solar Egyptian calendar, its appearance in the sky was closely observed.
                            <br>
                            In Greek mythology, Orion was a gigantic, strong hunter, born to Euryale, a Gorgon, and Poseidon, the god of the sea.
                            The constellation is also mentioned in Horace's Odes (Ode 3.27.18), Homer's Odyssey (Book 5, line 283) and Iliad, and Virgil's Aeneid (Book 1, line 535).
                            Allthough the name Orion was known in the greek-roman culture, it was also called the Giant or Hunter, which name was also taken over by the ancient arabic astronomers.
                            The constellation appears in almost all mythologies around the world, for example in the ancient hindu and middle-eastern culture, later in the european folklore, as well as
                            in the legends of many african, uralic and siberian tribes.

                        It is a white supergiant star and it has a mass 25 times and a surface brightness 60000 times of the Sun. It is located about 2.600 light-years away from Earth.

                        The Orion Nebula is a diffuse nebula situated in the Milky Way, being south of Orion's Belt.
                        It is one of the brightest nebulae, a true marvel of the night sky. Under dark skies it is clearly visible with the naked eye, from cities and light-polluted areas
                        it can be observed with binoculars. It is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth, therefore closely studied by scientists, but it is also a popular
                        target for hobby astronomers and astrophotographers.

                        The Horsehead Nebula (also known as Barnard 33) is a small dark nebula located near the Orion's Belt, its shape resembling to a horse head.
                        It is surrounded by other notable deep-sky objects, like the Flame Nebula (NGC2024), the emission and reflection nebula called NGC2023, or the reflection nebula
                        IC 435, and is part of the much larger Orion molecular cloud complex. It is quite hard to observe the nebula, as dark sky and a telescope at least 20 cm in diameter is needed for it,
                        but it truly shows its beautiful structures on astrophotos and photographic observations.
