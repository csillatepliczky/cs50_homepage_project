                            Cygnus is a northern constellation on the plane of our galaxy, the Milky Way, deriving its name from the Latinized Greek word for swan.
                            Cygnus is one of the most recognizable constellations of summer and autumn on the northern hemisphere, it is easy to find due to its large size.
                            Many deep-sky objects, like open clusters, nebulae of various types and supernova remnants can be found in Cygnus due to its position on the plane of the Milky Way.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify mb-5">
                            The constellation was already well-known throughout history, and can be found in many mythologies, like in arabic, roman or greek legends,
                            where it was identified first as bird, then later as swan. In Greek mythology, Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans.
                            Zeus disguised himself as a swan to seduce Leda, Spartan king Tyndareus's wife, who gave birth to the Gemini, Castor and Pollux.
                            Orpheus was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his lyre (Lyra), and the King Cygnus was transformed into a swan.

                            Later Romans also associated this constellation with the tragic story of Phaethon, the son of Helios the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.
                            Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river Eridanus.
                            According to the myth, Phaethon's close friend or lover, Cygnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.
                            The gods were so touched by Cygnus's devotion that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.
                            <br>Cygnus also appeared in other cultures, like Hinduism, native american legends or the mythology of New Zealand and Tonga.

                        The brigthest star in the constellation and also in the norther sky is called Deneb (deriving its name from the arabic 'al Dnanab al Dajajah', 'the tail of the bird'),
                        which forms the tail of the swan.
                        It is a white supergiant star and it has a mass 25 times and a surface brightness 60000 times of the Sun. It is located about 2.600 light-years away from Earth.

                        The North America Nebula is an emission nebula close to Deneb, consisting mainly of interstellar hydrogen gas.
                        It covers a region more than ten times the area of the full moon, and its shape resembles that of the continent of North America.
                        However its surface brightness is low, so it is only visible to the naked eye from under dark skies. It is located about 2.000 light-years away from Earth.

                        The Veil Nebula is a cloud of heated and ionized gas and dust. It is a remnant of a supernova which exploded between 10.000 and 20.000 years ago.
                        At the time of the explosion, the supernova appeared brighter than Venus, and it was visible during daytime in the sky.
                        The remnants have since expanded to cover a large area of the sky, and the nebula consists of three main parts:
